This is a program which takes a set of course selections as a file, then allows users to browse the course selections at several different municipial "hobby-centers".

Using commands within the program, users can enrol onto courses among other actions.

The base concept of this code is to have a database accessible and partially modifiable by the user, within certain set of rules preventing "rule-breaking".
