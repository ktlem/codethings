# README

This is a program which takes a set of course selections as a file, then allows users to browse the course selections at several different municipial "hobby-centers".

Using commands within the program, users can set limited parameters for their "searches", such as search by municipality or course theme.

The base concept of this code is to have a scaleable database accessible by the user via an interface, with options.
