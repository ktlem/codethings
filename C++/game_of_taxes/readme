# README

This folder contains the files for 'Game of Taxes', a program which shows the tax-vassalship connections of medieval (or modern!) cities.

Users may enter cities and their data by hand, or import from file, then manipulate the connections using commands within the program.

Efficiency of each method is listed and described in datastructures.hh
There may be small errors in the efficiencies, and in the efficiency of the code itself.

The base concept of this code is portable to any hierarchically connected data, that does not loop back to itself.
