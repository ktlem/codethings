This is a classic path game. The game board is a grid, with red pieces on the top-most row and green pieces at the very bottom. 
The objective is to move all the green pieces to the top and all the red pieces to the bottom.

The game's code will handle exceptions, such as attempting to move a piece out of bounds or to a filled slot.

The basic principle of this code is to demonstrate a simple piece-and-board type of game.
